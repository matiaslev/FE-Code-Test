# Code Challenge

## Instructions:

Please clone the repository, complete the exercise, and submit a PR for us to review! If you have any questions, you can reach out directly here or leave comments on your pull request which we will respond to. Remember, all instructions for running the application (including installing relevant libraries, etc.) should be included in the README. 


## Delivery Steps: 

1. Create a branch from `master` named `base` and push all the third-party code needed (Libraries, Frameworks, etc.).
2. Create a branch from `base` named `code-test` and push your own code (Remember to update the Readme file providing any instructions on how to run the project if needed).
3. Create a Pull Request from `code-test` to `base` for us to review.


## Please answer the following questions once you finish codding:

A) Describe the strategy used to consume the API endpoints and the data management.

I used retrofit to consume the API and ROOM for save the responses locally. Also I used mappers to manage the data
between cloud, database and domain.

B) Explain which library was used for the routing and why. Would you use the same for a consumer facing app targeting thousands of users? Why?

I used activities and Intents for routing, but I will use fragments if a more flexible UI that could support tablets is needed. Also,
The navigation library from Jetpack is pretty interesting applications.
Anyway, the three options are viable for apps with thousands of users.

C) Have you used any strategy to optimize the performance of the list generated for the first feature?

I used the paging library for improve the performance of the list rendered in the first feature.

D) Would you like to add any further comments or observations?

* Tested with mockk
* With Clean Architecture in mind
* MVVM for the presentation layer
* Clean Code


## Overview:

Implement a simple mobile cocktails catalogue (master / detail). The catalogue consists of a table view list of cocktails with their name, toppings and photo. Once the user taps on a specific row it will push a new screen with that drink’s details: Name, Photo, Ingredients and Preparation.


## Features:

**1. Cocktails list:**

For each row of the list it will display the Cocktail name and photo (See wireframe 1).
The API endpoint that should be consumed for this purpose is: 

http://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?g=Cocktail_glass

This returns a JSON list of cocktails, and the information needed in order to populate each row of the list.

```
{
 	strDrink,           → Cocktail name
     	strDrinkThumb,  → Photo URL
      	idDrink       → Cocktail ID
}
```

**2. Cocktail detail:**

Once the user taps on a row from the list mentioned in the previous feature it will push a new screen with the selected cocktail’s details, where it will show it’s name, photo, ingredients and instructions (See wireframe 2)

The endpoint to be used for this is the following:
 
http://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=${idDrink} → Cocktail ID
I.g.: http://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=16108

The endpoint returns a JSON with the cocktails info, the needed properties are:
```
{
	strInstructions,  → instructions
	strDrink,         → cocktail name
	strDrinkThumb,    → photo URL
	strIngredient1,   → ingredient 1
	...
	strIngredientN    → ingredient N
}
```

**3. Bonus Points: (Optional)**

Implement a filter by name functionality on the first screen that automatically filters the results while typing, only showing the rows that satisfy the criteria entered by the user.



Thank you and looking forward to seeing your great work!
